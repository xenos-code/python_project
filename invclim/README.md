# invclim
A set of tools for identifying temperature inversions and cloud layers from 
weather balloon data.

The primary tools here are *invfinder* and *cloudfinder*.

These are the main tools used for my inversion climatology paper.
Scripts has a few things used for the paper as well. (mostly to do)

* setup_station_list.py 
* calculate_inversions.py
* calculate_cloud_layers.py
* generate_summary_tables.py
